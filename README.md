## 🧠 About the Formation
The **Jobintech Fullstack Formation** is a professional program designed to teach the foundations of **modern web development**.  
It combines theory and practice through hands-on projects that simulate real-world scenarios.

During this formation, I learned how to:
- Write clean, structured JavaScript code.
- Build dynamic server-side applications with Node.js.
- Develop RESTful APIs using Express.js.
- Work with JSON data and asynchronous functions.
- Organize projects following the MVC architecture.
- Deploy and test backend applications.

This program strengthened both my **frontend and backend** development skills, giving me the ability to create complete fullstack applications from scratch.
