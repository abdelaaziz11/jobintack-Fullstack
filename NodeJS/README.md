## 🧠 About the Formation
The **Node.js Formation** at **Jobintech** is a core part of the Fullstack Developer program.  
It focuses on building **server-side logic**, **handling HTTP requests**, and **managing APIs** using Node.js — a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine.

This formation provided me with practical experience in developing backend applications, managing files, handling asynchronous operations, and understanding how servers work under the hood.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of the Node.js Formation, I was able to:
- Understand what Node.js is and how it works.  
- Create and run HTTP servers using Node’s built-in modules.  
- Handle routes, requests, and responses manually.  
- Work with files using the **fs** module.  
- Manage asynchronous code using **callbacks**, **Promises**, and **async/await**.  
- Use environment variables and modular architecture.  
- Debug and test Node.js applications.  
- Build small API-based projects.
