# 🖥️ Node System Logger — Mini Project

## 📘 Description

The **Node System Logger** is a command-line mini project built with **Node.js**.  
It monitors the system’s activity (memory, CPU usage, uptime, etc.), logs the data into a file, and provides a simple **HTTP server** to view the logs in real time.  

This project demonstrates key Node.js concepts such as:
- Working with **core modules** (`os`, `fs`, `http`, `events`)
- Using **EventEmitter** to handle custom events
- Writing and reading from files
- Creating a simple HTTP server
- Running periodic tasks using `setInterval()`

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The main goal of this mini project is to:
1. **Monitor system activity** (memory, uptime, etc.) in real time.  
2. **Log data** to a text file automatically every few seconds.  
3. **Emit and handle events** such as “low memory” warnings.  
4. **Serve logs and stats** through a local HTTP server.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

## 🧩 Files Explanation

### 1. `logger.js`
- Defines a **Logger** class that extends Node’s built-in `EventEmitter`.
- Responsible for writing messages to `log.txt`.
- Emits a `messageLogged` event each time data is written.
- Emits a `lowMemory` event when system memory is below 20%.

**Key concepts used:**  
➡️ EventEmitter, File System (fs), Custom events.

---

### 2. `monitor.js`
- Main script that imports both `os` and the custom `Logger` module.  
- Uses `setInterval()` to:
  - Collect system info every **5 seconds**:
    - Free memory  
    - Total memory  
    - System uptime  
    - Free memory percentage  
  - Log this data using `logger.log()`.
- Detects when free memory drops below 20% and emits a **lowMemory** alert.

**Key concepts used:**  
➡️ OS module, Timers (`setInterval`), Event handling, File logging.

---

### 3. `server.js`
- Creates a simple **HTTP server** that listens on port **3000**.
- Handles 3 main routes:
  - `/` → Displays a welcome message.  
  - `/logs` → Displays the content of `log.txt`.  
  - `/stats` → Displays the current system stats in **JSON format**.
- Uses the `fs` module to read log files and the `os` module to collect stats.

**Key concepts used:**  
➡️ HTTP module, File reading, Routing, JSON response.

---

### 4. `log.txt`
- A text file automatically created and updated by `logger.js`.  
- Contains a time-stamped record of each system check (every 5 seconds).
